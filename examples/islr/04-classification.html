<p><strong>Classification</strong></p>
<p>When the predictor <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is assumed to be <em>qualitative</em> (or <em>categorical</em>) rather than quantitative (as in linear regression); <em>classification</em> is the process used to make these predictions, because we are seeking to <em>classify</em> an observation into a category, factor, or class. However, if the classification method first predicts the <em>probability</em> that an observation is a member of a class before assigning the label (which can often be the case) then these methods behave a lot <em>like</em> linear regression. Classification techniques are called <em>classifiers</em>; and the classifiers covered in chapter four are:</p>
<ul>
<li>logistic regression</li>
<li>linear discriminant analysis</li>
<li>K-nearest neighbors</li>
</ul>
<p>The more computationally heavy methods will be covered in other chapters, e.g., generalized additive models(<a href="link.html">Chapter 7</a>), trees, random forests, boosting (<a href="link.html">Chapter 8</a>), and support vector machines (<a href="link.html">Chapter 9</a>)</p>
<div id="section" class="section level2">
<h2>4.1</h2>
<p><strong>Overview of classification</strong></p>
<p>Examples of classification problems:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Health setting:</em> using a set of symptoms to determin which of three possible condition is the root cause</li>
<li><em>Security/banking setting:</em> detecting whether or not a transaction is fraudulent using an IP address, past transaction history, or other data</li>
<li><em>Health setting:</em> finding out which DNA mutations are causing disease using DNA sequence data for patients with and without a given disease</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as in regression, we use a set of training data <span class="math inline">\((x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)\)</span> that we can use to build a classifier. A good classifier performs well on training and test data and what we want is a good classifier.</p>
<p>In the chapter the <code>ISLR::Default</code> data will be used to illustrate the concepts of classification. We’ll be interested in predicting whether or not an individual will default on their credit card payment, on the basis of annual income and monthly credit card balance. The data set is displayed below (<em>Figure 4.1</em>) where annual <code>income</code> and monthly credit card <code>balance</code> is plot for a subset of the 10,000 observations. The right side is boxplots.</p>

<p><img src="04-classification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>Figure 4.1</strong> <em>This is a very pronounced relationship between predictor <code>balance</code> and response <code>default</code>–in the real world, the relationships between predictors and responses will not be nearly as strong. A somewhat exaggerated predictor/response relationship is helpful for illustrating classification</em></p>
<p>We will learn to build a model to predict <code>default</code> <span class="math inline">\((Y)\)</span> for any given value of <code>balance</code> <span class="math inline">\((X_1)\)</span> and <code>income</code> <span class="math inline">\((X_2)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is not quantitative, the simple linear regression model of Chapter 3 is not appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-1" class="section level2">
<h2>4.2</h2>
<p><strong>Why not linear regression?</strong></p>
<p>Say we are trying to predict the medical condition of a patient in the emergency room on the basis of their symptoms; in this simplified example, there are three possible diagnoses: stroke, drug overdose, and epileptic seizure. We could encode these as a quantitative response variable, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if stroke;} \\ 
2 &amp; \text{if drug overdose}\\
3 &amp; \text{if epileptic seizure}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using this coding, least squares could be used to fit a linear model to predict <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on the basis of a set of predictors <span class="math inline">\(X_1,\ldots,X_p\)</span>. Unfortunately this coding implies ordering on the outcomes; putting drug overdoese between stroke and epileptic seizure. The ordering is, in reality, arbitrary–we could also encode it like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if epileptic seizure} \\
2 &amp; \text{if stroke}\\
3 &amp; \text{if drug overdose}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>This would imply a totally different relationship among the three conditions. Each of these codings would produce fundamentally different linear models that would ultimately lead to different sets of predictions on test observations. If the response variable did take on a natural ordering, e.g., <em>mild</em>, <em>moderate</em>, <em>severe</em>, we could use this approach but we would need to be fairly certain that the gap between <em>mild</em> and <em>moderate</em> is nearly the same as the gap between <em>moderate</em> and <em>severe</em>. There is no natuarl way to do this conversion, which is why it’s not a great idea to force data into a model it’s not meant for.</p>
<p>With a <em>binary</em> qualitative response, the situation is better; if there are only two possibilities for the patient’s medical condition: stroke and drug overdoes, we could use a <em>dummy variable</em> from section <span class="math inline">\((3.3.1)\)</span> to code the response as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y=\begin{cases}
0 &amp; \text{if stroke} \\
1 &amp; \text{if drug overdose}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>We could then fit a linear regression to this binary response, and predict drug overdose if <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}&gt;0.5\)</span> and stroke otherwise. Flipping the coding in this case will not alter the result, so it is not a bad approach. It makes sense and it can be shown that the <span class="math inline">\(X\hat{\beta}\)</span> obtained is an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(\text{drug overdose}|X\)</span>; however, is we use linear regression some of the estimates can fall outside of the <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> interval, which would make it hard to interpret as probabilities. We can think of them as <em>crude probability estimates</em>. The dummy variable approach cannot be easily extended to accomodate qualitative responses with more than two levels, which is why it is preferable to use a classification method that is truly suited for qualitative response values.</p>
</div>
<div id="logistic-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>4.3 logistic regression</h2>
<p>Using the <code>defualt</code> data set as an example again, remember that the response variable <code>default</code> falls into one of two categoreis: <code>Yes</code> or <code>No</code>. Rather than modeling this reponse logistic regression models the <em>probability</em> that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> belongs to a particular category.</p>
<p>For the <code>default</code> data, logistic regression models the probability of default, e.g., the probability of default given <code>balance</code> can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Pr(\text{default}=\text{Yes}|\text{balance})
\]</span></p>
<p>The values of <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(\text{default}=\text{Yes}|\text{balance})\)</span>, which we abbreviate <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{balance})\)</span>, will range between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. So, for any given value of <code>balance</code>, a prediction can be made for <code>default</code>, e.g., we could predict <span class="math inline">\(\text{default}=\text{Yes}\)</span> for any individual for whom <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{balance})&gt;0.5\)</span>; or, we could be <em>conservative</em> in predicting individuals who are <em>at risk</em> for default and choose a lower threshold, like <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{balance})&gt;0.1\)</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="section-2" class="section level3">
<h3>4.3.1</h3>
<p><strong>The logistic model</strong></p>
<p>How should we model the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(p(X)=\Pr(Y=1|X)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>? (for convenience we’re using <code>0/1</code> coding for the response). In <span class="math inline">\((4.2)\)</span> we talked about using linear regression to represent these probabilities</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(X)=\beta_0+\beta_1X
\tag{4.1}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we use this approach to predict <code>default = Yes</code> using <code>balance</code>, then we obtain the model shown in the left hand side of <strong>Figure 4.2</strong>. We see the problem with this approach: for balances close to <code>0</code> we predict a negative probability of <code>default</code>; if we were to predict very large balances we would get values bigger than <code>1</code>. These predictions are not sensible, since of course the true probability of default, regardless of credit card balance, must fall between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. Any time a straight line is fit to a binary response that is coded as <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> this will occur.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, we must model <span class="math inline">\(p(X)\)</span> using a funciton that gives outputs between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> for all values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Many functions meet this description, but for logistic regression we use the <em>logistic function</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(X)=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}
\tag{4.2}
\]</span></p>
<p>To fit model <span class="math inline">\((4.2)\)</span>, we use a method called <em>maximum likelihood</em>, which we discuss in the next section. The right hand side of <strong>Figure 4.2</strong> illustrates the fit of the logistic regression model to the <code>default</code> data. In contrast to linear regression low balance predictions using logistic regression estimates are close to but not below <code>0</code>; likewise, for high balances, estimates are close to but never over <code>1</code>. This model is better at capturing a range of probabilities than linear regression is and the logistic function will always produce an S-shaped curve of this form, so, regardless of the .</p>

provides a strong API for sequentially \n    building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of multiple\n    plots. 'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow for \n    arbitrarily complex composition of plots by providing mathmatical operators\n    for combining multiple plots. Other packages that addresses this need (but\n    with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","Imports":"ggplot2 (>= 3.0.0),\ngtable,\ngrid,\nstats,\ngrDevices,\nutils","RoxygenNote":"6.0.1.9000","Roxygen":"list(markdown = TRUE)","URL":"https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork","BugReports":"https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork/issues","RemoteType":"github","RemoteHost":"api.github.com","RemoteRepo":"patchwork","RemoteUsername":"thomasp85","RemoteRef":"master","RemoteSha":"7fb35b1fc8d42096df6f696a0123685bab1db777","GithubRepo":"patchwork","GithubUsername":"thomasp85","GithubRef":"master","GithubSHA1":"7fb35b1fc8d42096df6f696a0123685bab1db777","Author":"Thomas Lin Pedersen [cre, aut]","Built":"R 3.5.1; ; 2018-08-06 18:25:54 UTC; unix"},"broom":{"Type":"Package","Package":"broom","Title":"Convert Statistical Objects into Tidy Tibbles","Version":"0.5.0.9001","Authors@R":"c(\n    person(\"David\", \"Robinson\", email = \"admiral.david@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")),\n    person(\"Alex\", \"Hayes\", email = \"alexpghayes@gmail.com\", role = \"aut\"),\n    person(\"Matthieu\", \"Gomez\", email = \"mattg@princeton.edu\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Boris\", \"Demeshev\", email = \"boris.demeshev@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Dieter\", \"Menne\", email = \"dieter.menne@menne-biomed.de\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Benjamin\", \"Nutter\", email = \"nutter@battelle.org\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Luke\", \"Johnston\", email = \"luke.johnston@mail.utoronto.ca\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Ben\", \"Bolker\", email = \"bolker@mcmaster.ca\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Francois\", \"Briatte\", email = \"f.briatte@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Jeffrey\", \"Arnold\", email = \"jeffrey.arnold@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Jonah\", \"Gabry\", email = \"jsg2201@columbia.edu\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Luciano\", \"Selzer\", email = \"luciano.selzer@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Gavin\", \"Simpson\", email = \"ucfagls@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Jens\", \"Preussner\", email = \" jens.preussner@mpi-bn.mpg.de\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Jay\", \"Hesselberth\", email = \"jay.hesselberth@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Hadley\", \"Wickham\", email = \"hadley@rstudio.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Matthew\", \"Lincoln\", email = \"matthew.d.lincoln@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Alessandro\", \"Gasparini\", email = \"ag475@leicester.ac.uk\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Lukasz\", \"Komsta\", email = \"lukasz.komsta@umlub.pl\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Frederick\", \"Novometsky\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Wilson\", \"Freitas\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Michelle\", \"Evans\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Jason Cory\", \"Brunson\", email = \"cornelioid@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Simon\", \"Jackson\", email = \"drsimonjackson@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Ben\", \"Whalley\", email = \"ben.whalley@plymouth.ac.uk\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Michael\", \"Kuehn\", email = \"mkuehn10@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Jorge\", \"Cimentada\", email = \"cimentadaj@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Erle\", \"Holgersen\", email = \"erle.holgersen@gmail.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Karl\", \"Dunkle Werner\", role = \"ctb\"),\n    person(\"Steven\", \"Pav\", email = \"shabbychef@gmail.com\", role=\"ctb\"))","Maintainer":"David Robinson <admiral.david@gmail.com>","Description":"Summarizes key information about statistical objects in tidy\n    tibbles.
